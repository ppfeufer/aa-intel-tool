______________________________________________________________________

> **Note**
>
> This app makes use of a feature introduced with Alliance Auth v3.6.1, meaning,
> installing this app will pull in Alliance Auth v3.6.1 unsupervised if you haven't
> updated yet.
>
> **Please make sure to update Allianceauth to version 3.6.1 or higher before you
> install this app to avoid any complications.**

## Overview<a name="overview"></a>

### Features<a name="features"></a>

The following modules can be enabled or disabled.
See [Settings](#settings) section for details.

- Chat scan module (Disabled by default due to its possible high number of ESI calls)
- D-Scan module

### Screenshots<a name="screenshots"></a>

#### Chat Scan<a name="chat-scan"></a>

## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

> **Note**
>
> Please make sure you meet all preconditions before you proceed:
>
> - AA Intel Tool is a plugin for [Alliance Auth]. If you don't have Alliance Auth running
>   already, please install it first before proceeding. (see the official
>   [Alliance Auth installation guide] for details)
> - AA Intel Tool needs at least **Alliance Auth v3.6.1**. Please make sure to meet this
>   condition _before_ installing this app, otherwise an update to Alliance Auth will
>   be pulled in unsupervised.
> - AA Intel Tool needs [Eve Universe] to function. Please make sure it is installed,
>   before continuing.

### Step 1: Install the Package<a name="step-1-install-the-package"></a>

Make sure you're in the virtual environment (venv) of your Alliance Auth
installation Then install the latest release directly from PyPi.

```shell
pip install aa-intel-tool
```

### Step 2: Configure Alliance Auth<a name="step-2-configure-alliance-auth"></a>

#### Add the App to Alliance Auth<a name="add-the-app-to-alliance-auth"></a>

This is fairly simple, configure your AA settings (`local.py`) as follows:

Add `eveuniverse` (if not already done so for a different app) and `aa_intel_tool` to
the list of `INSTALLED_APPS`.

```python
# Add any additional apps to this list.
INSTALLED_APPS += [
    "eveuniverse",
    "aa_intel_tool",  # https://github.com/ppfeufer/aa-intel-tool
]
```

#### Add the Scheduled Task<a name="add-the-scheduled-task"></a>

To remove old scans from your DB, add the following task.
The retention time can be adjusted through the `INTELTOOL_SCAN_RETENTION_TIME` setting.

```python
if "aa_intel_tool" in INSTALLED_APPS:
    # Run at 01:00 each day
    CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE["AA Intel Tool :: Housekeeping"] = {
        "task": "aa_intel_tool.tasks.housekeeping",
        "schedule": crontab(minute="0", hour="1"),
    }
```

#### (Optional) Allow Public Views<a name="optional-allow-public-views"></a>

This app supports AA's feature of public views. To allow this feature, please add
`"aa_intel_tool",` to the list of `APPS_WITH_PUBLIC_VIEWS` in your `local.py`:

```python
# By default, apps are prevented from having public views for security reasons.
# To allow specific apps to have public views, add them to APPS_WITH_PUBLIC_VIEWS
#   » The format is the same as in INSTALLED_APPS
#   » The app developer must also explicitly allow public views for their app
APPS_WITH_PUBLIC_VIEWS = [
    "aa_intel_tool",  # https://github.com/ppfeufer/aa-intel-tool
]
```

> **Note**
>
> If you don't have a list for `APPS_WITH_PUBLIC_VIEWS` yet, then add the whole
> block from here. This feature has been added in Alliance Auth v3.6.0 so you
> might not yet have this list in your `local.py`.

### Step 4: Preload Eve Universe Data<a name="step-4-preload-eve-universe-data"></a>

AA Intel Tool utilizes the EveUniverse module, so it doesn't need to ask ESI for ship
information. To set this up, you now need to run the following command.

```shell
python manage.py aa_intel_tool_load_eve_types
```

### Step 5: Finalizing the Installation<a name="step-5-finalizing-the-installation"></a>

Run static files collection and migrations.

```shell
python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py migrate
```

Restart your supervisor services for Auth.

### Step 6: Update Your Webserver Configuration<a name="step-6-update-your-webserver-configuration"></a>

By default, webservers have a timout of about 30 seconds for requests. So we have to
tweak that a little bit, since parsing intel data can take a while, and we don't want
the webserver to spoil our fun, right?

#### Apache 2<a name="apache-2"></a>

Open your vhost configuration and add the following 2 lines right after the
`ProxyPreserveHost On` directive:

```apache
ProxyTimeout 600
Timeout      600
```

Restart your Apache2 service.

#### Nginx<a name="nginx"></a>

Open your vhost configuration and add the following lines inside the `location / {`
directive:

```nginx
proxy_connect_timeout 600;
proxy_read_timeout    600;
proxy_send_timeout    600;
send_timeout          600;
```

Restart your Nginx service.

## Settings<a name="settings"></a>

To customize the app, the following settings are available and can be made in
your `local.py`.

> **Warning**
>
> Enable the chat scan module at your own risk. This module has the potential to
> generate a huge number of ESI calls, which CCP might not be too happy about.

| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| INTELTOOL_ENABLE_MODULE_CHATSCAN  | Enable or disable the chat scan module.                                                                                                  | False   |
| INTELTOOL_ENABLE_MODULE_DSCAN     | Enable or disable the d-scan module.                                                                                                     | True    |
| INTELTOOL_ENABLE_MODULE_FLEETCOMP | Enable or disable the fleet composition module.                                                                                          | True    |
| INTELTOOL_SCAN_RETENTION_TIME     | Set the time in days for how long the scans will be kept in the database. Set to 0 to keep scans indefinitely.                           | 30      |
| INTELTOOL_CHATSCAN_MAX_PILOTS     | Set the limit of pilots for chat scans, since these can take quite a long time to process. Set to 0 to disable.                          | 500     |
| INTELTOOL_DSCAN_GRID_SIZE         | Set the grid size for D-Scans. This defines <br/>the size of the grid in km in which ships and structures are considered to be "on grid" | 10000   |

> **Note**
>
> **A word about the chat scan limitations:**
>
> It is advised to keep the `INTELTOOL_CHATSCAN_MAX_PILOTS` to a sane number. Large
> chat scans can take quite some time to parse and from a certain number of pilots, the
> bottleneck might be your browser refusing to render the results page.
